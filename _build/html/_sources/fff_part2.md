# Growing Flowers in Finite Fields (Part 1)

[lemonade looks at plant in finte field]

This section will be about the ways we can visualize the rather abstract structure of the degree 2 finite field we constructed in the previous part. 

Recall how the field $\mathbb F_3$ was visualized as a circle:

[Image of circle with three ticks]

We could also view this as a line with three ticks, with portals on each end which wrap it on itself. 

[Portals image]

The field of nine elements we constructed in the last part could be visualized in a similar way, but with two axes: one for the constant term of the polynomial, and one for the coefficient of $x$. 

[Portals 2 image]

This portals image captures the way that the world $\mathbb F_3[x] / (x^2 + 1)$ "wraps around on itself" when you take three steps in any direction. 

[Develop addition]

This gives us a way to see the way addition acts in this world: adding $1$ corresponds to a rightward step, adding $x$ corresponds to an upward step. These actions combine in the natural way: for example, adding $1 + 2x$ corresponds to a step right and two steps up (travelling through the portals as necessary.)

What does multiplication look like? Here's how multiplying by $x$ looks in this field:

[Graph here]

Recall that the nonzero elements can be generated by powers of $1+x$. We can follow the results of each multiplication like a path to get this graph:

[Graph here]

This doesn't really help us too much, though - there is no apparent pattern. But we haven't used the fact that the field "wraps around on itself" yet.

What if, instead of having portals, we simply let the field tile itself infinitely?

[Graph]

Then, there are infinitely many points that could represent, say $0$. It is of course represented by the point $(0, 0)$, but also $(3, 0)$, $(0, 6)$, and in general any coordinate $(x, y)$ such that $x$ and $y$ are both multiples of 3. (This has to do with the fact that 3 = 0 in our world)

The idea that will generate our flowers is that, when we follow the path of the powers of our generator $(1+x)$, we should at each step choose the *closest* point that represents the result of our computations. This is demonstrated below:

[big graph]

Now, the result is something much more nice to look at! It reminds me of those things that ninjas throw.

[lemonade throwing star]

We can now apply this to a bigger field: take $\mathbb F_7 [x] / (x^2 + 1)$ with the generator !REPLACE THIS!!!!!

Choosing another generator, !!Second generator!! we get:

The shapes shown all have 4-fold rotational symmetry. Why does this happen?

Here's how multiplication by $x$ acts on the field $\mathbb F_3[x] / (x^2 + 1)$ from before. You'll notice it's a rotation by $90 ^ \circ$. 

When our list of powers must eventually hit $x$ (or $-x$, whatever it hits first) - which it must, since it hits every nonzero element the path it draws will simply repeat what it has done up to that point, rotated by a right angle. Eventually it hits $-1$, at which point it repeats what it has done up to that point, rotated by $180^ \circ$, completing the picture. (Recall that $x^2 = -1$ in this world.)

Let's choose some bigger primes and do the same process. 

[lots of images]

At a small scale these images look chaotic, but zooming out they reveal the patterns and structure of the fields they spawn from. 

These images were generated with some python code. It's fun just to play with, choosing random generators to draw cycles from, creating these wildly detailed pictures. (The code is on the next page, which you can download and modify if that's your thing!)

Here are some of my favorites:

I've left a lot of details out of this discussion. Maybe in the future I'll write a more thorough discussion of these shapes. But for now, this seems like a good place to stop and have a picnic. 

[the end]
